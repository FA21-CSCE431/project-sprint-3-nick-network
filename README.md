This website was created for an academic project that provided an organization with a place to communicate. It was made by a 6 member group taking a software engineering class.
 
Website contains the following pages: home, about us, events, meetings, news feed, gallery, products, contact, and members. 
The home page is the landing page upon entering the website, it includes links to every other page on the navigation bar. It displays a photo of the organization and their main values.
The About Us page shows more information and history about the organization, and displays the requirements to join it, and its president and officers.
The Events page requires the user to log in, as only users that belong to the organization can access it. It displays all events that are planned for the organization, where an administrator can create, edit, and destroy any post, while regular members can only view it.
The meeting pages allow the organization to create meetings that can only be accessed by members. It’s a way to communicate with each member when there’s a meeting that will occur.
The news feed page allows the users to create any news that is circulating amongst the Nickwork. It allows the Nicks to be up to date on any new news.
